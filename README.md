## What's a Kollabra?

Kollabra is a passion project of Lee (Web Ninja). He's designed a logo, he's come up with a plan, he's designed some app designs - - lets do it! 

Kollabra is (eventually) a job portal website (basic Indeed/etc) but for the NFT community. You can sign up (connecting to Twitter only for now) and choose to be a company (job poster) or a creative (someone looking for jobs). The goal is to connect NFT communities who need help (developers, contract writers, designers, brand specialists, etc) with the huge pool of gig workers out there looking for work.

Kollabra is still in the works - trying to find time between a 9-5 and enjoying life to the fullest!
